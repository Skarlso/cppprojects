# Day 15 Timing

With vector

```bash
3543984
./solution  0.45s user 0.00s system 98% cpu 0.454 total
```

With pure variables

```bash
3543984
./solution  0.07s user 0.00s system 95% cpu 0.080 total
```

Much nicer solution with `std::all_of` and a member function for discs. Thanks @yitsushi.

```bash

./solution  0.12s user 0.00s system 97% cpu 0.122 total
